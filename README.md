# Machine Learning Research

This repository contains ongoing research work focused on machine learning and data science. The goal of this work is to explore, implement, and evaluate modern machine learning techniques through structured experimentation and reproducible code.

## Overview
This research emphasizes applied machine learning methods, with attention to data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and analysis. The work includes exploratory experiments as well as more structured implementations designed to investigate performance, scalability, and practical behavior of different approaches.

The repository is actively maintained and expanded as research progresses.

## Areas of Focus
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g. PCA and related methods)  
- Clustering and unsupervised learning  
- Supervised learning and model evaluation  
- Experimental analysis and comparison of models  
- Reproducible machine learning workflows  

## Repository Structure
- `notebooks/`  
  Jupyter notebooks used for experimentation, analysis, and visualization of results.

- `src/`  
  Python source code for reusable components such as preprocessing pipelines, models, evaluation utilities, and helper functions.

- `experiments/`  
  Supporting files and documentation related to specific experimental setups.

- `docs/`  
  Additional documentation describing research goals, methodology, or design decisions.

## Status
This research is **ongoing**.  
The contents of this repository represent selected work and evolving experiments. Additional results, refinements, and new directions are added incrementally.

## Notes
Large datasets and sensitive materials are intentionally excluded. The focus of this repository is on methodology, code quality, and experimental reasoning rather than raw data distribution.
