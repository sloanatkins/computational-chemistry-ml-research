# Machine Learning & Data Science Research

This repository contains ongoing research and experimentation in **machine learning and data science**, with an emphasis on **data preprocessing, dataset balancing, and exploratory analysis**. The work is research-oriented and iterative rather than a finalized application.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to explore techniques for improving dataset quality prior to model training. Current work focuses on analyzing structured datasets and applying balancing strategies to prepare data for downstream machine learning tasks.

## Contents
- **`DataBalancer.ipynb`**  
  A Jupyter Notebook that explores dataset inspection, preprocessing, and balancing techniques. The notebook documents experimental logic and serves as a foundation for future modeling work.

- **`molecular_data.csv`**  
  A sample dataset used for experimentation and analysis within the notebook.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## Research Focus
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling imbalanced datasets
- Exploratory data analysis
- Preparing data for machine learning pipelines

## Status
This project is **ongoing**. Additional notebooks, experiments, and models will be added as research progresses.
